                        <p class="text-box-text">Also known as collagen induction therapy, it’s a treatment using a dermapen with a needle cartridge, this causes trauma to the skin, the process of healing starts straight away and renews the skin cells. As it repairs the skin produces collagen and elastin and this gives an immediate plumping effect. Again the benefits to this are amazing, reducing the appearance of fine lines and wrinkles, keloid scarring, sun damage, ageing, shrinks large pores, reduces rosacea and improves acne.  </p><br>
                        <p class="text-box-text">The treatment continues to boost the appearance of your complexion, for months afterwards. For maximum results and improvement, this treatment is better done in a course of at least one every four weeks for three months.</p>

                        <p class="text-box-text">This can be done on its own as a facial or with the peel and microneedling. This innovative treatment uses a variety of colour wavelengths of visible light, which have their own specific benefit. The skin uses the light as an energy source to start to repair and rejuvenate itself, fixing damaged cells and getting rid of bacteria.  </p><br>
                        <p class="text-box-text">The light energy also boosts circulation, tissue repair and the production of collagen and elastin. The benefits of a steam facial include extra cleansing, it promotes circulation, releases acne causing bacteria and cells, it releases trapped sebum, it’s hydrating, it helps your skin absorb skin care products, it promotes collagen and elastin and it’s very soothing.</p>
